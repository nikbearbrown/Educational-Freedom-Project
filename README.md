# The Educational Freedom Project

The Educational Freedom Project (EFP) is a student-led organization dedicated to defending and advancing the "promise of higher education," which it sees as being threatened. The organization aims to transform students' passion into tangible action to carry this promise forward.

## The Promise of Higher Education

According to the EFP, the promise of higher education is an aspirational vision for universities. This promise includes universities being havens for **learning, teaching, expression, and opportunity**. The EFP states that this promise is under threat from both within universities and from government overreach.

### Internal Challenges

The EFP identifies several internal issues within universities that are causing a drift from the "aspirational promise," including:

* The rising cost of tuition and a decrease in accessibility
* Students feeling unprepared for the workforce
* The stifling of student expression due to strict rules and fear of "standing out"
* Professors being overburdened, underpaid, and sidelined from administrative decisions
* A decline in the "oasis of opportunity" that should define the university experience

### External Challenges

The EFP also believes the promise of higher education is "under siege" by the current federal government's attacks, which it claims are an effort to centralize control through "intimidation, coercion, and censorship". The organization cites the following as evidence of these attacks:

* International students living in constant fear of speaking out
* Professors' lives being uprooted by financial uncertainty imposed on universities
* Cuts to life-saving research and financial aid
* The enforcement of a "one way of understanding"

## Core Pillars and Goals

The EFP has four core pillars that align with the promise of higher education:

* **Learning**: The EFP believes learning should be accessible, inclusive, safe, and affordable
* **Teaching**: The EFP pledges to fight for the independence of universities and the job security of professors, and to stand against political overreach in the classroom
* **Expression**: The organization sees campuses as "sanctuaries for freedom of speech, assembly, and expression"
* **Opportunity**: The EFP advocates for universities to be hubs of opportunity, providing students with skills for the workforce, and supporting research and upskilling

To achieve its mission, the EFP has three primary goals:

1. **Mobilize students** to protect universities from government attacks
2. **Build a long-lasting student advocacy infrastructure** across universities
3. **Implement reforms** that promote the four core pillars: teaching, learning, expression, and opportunity
